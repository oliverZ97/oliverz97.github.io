# Anime Quiz

What started as a attempt to make my own small anime quiz already grewed bigger than I thought, but I just was to fun to stop.
We already have a selection of over 500 Anime characters and over 80 animes which are being part of this quiz.

A selection of different gamemodes in a daily and an endless version for competing yourself as multiple fun modes like Kiss, Marry & Kill is already playable.

I hope to add a lot of new fun gamemodes and a better user experience to the existing ones.

Have fun playing :3
